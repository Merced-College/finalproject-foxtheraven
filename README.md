# Final Project - Dungeons of Java

Xandra Quevedo / Due 12/8/25 / Submitted 12/5/25

My final project, Dungeons of Java, is a simple text adventure game with exploration and combat. As it stands, it is unfinished, and only the first combat sequence is fully working. However, it is possible to wander the entire map and reach "the end."

To play, use the WASD keys to move, and in battle, either use AA (attack aggressively), AC (attack carefully), or PY (protect yourself) based on the enemy's behavior.

Note: The map is *not* a straight line, despite the message print statement always stating a hallway is *in front of you.* To actually find the end, you would need to reference the drawn game map.
